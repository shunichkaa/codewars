#Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.
#Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.










def sum_of_intervals(intervals):
    intervals.sort()
    merged = []
    for start, end in intervals:
        if not merged or start > merged[-1][1]:
            merged.append([start, end])
        else:
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], end)
    return sum(end - start for start, end in merged)
