#The 26 letters of the English alphabets are randomly divided into 5 groups of 5 letters
#with the remaining letter being ignored.
#Each of the group is assigned a score of more than 0.
#The ignored letter always has a score of 0.

#With this kata, write a function nameScore(name) to work out the score of a name that is passed to the function.
